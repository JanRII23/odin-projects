        <em><h4>Importance of Protein Powder</h4></em>
        <p>Protein powder has been shown to increase muscle mass, improve strength and power and decrease fat mass. Unfortunately, many of us are stuck in a rut of using protein powder on repeat in our morning smoothie. You might be surprised to learn that protein powder is quite versatile, and there are many ways to use it besides your morning smoothie – including this protein-rich banana bread recipe.</p>
