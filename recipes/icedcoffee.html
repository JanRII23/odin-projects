        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> The best <strong>Iced Coffee</strong> beverage served is fast and easy. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee in the normal way and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water. </p>
